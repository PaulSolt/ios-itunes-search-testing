    /// * UI tests for search terms should populate the table view
    /// * Searching apps it should return apps, not music (check the enum values)
    /// * Test the URL is what we'd expect for apps, music, software, etc.
    /// * Edge cases
    /// * What happens when there are spaces in the search term, is that being correctly handled?
    /// * What happens with no results? Does the app display appropiate feedback?
    /// * What kinds of errors do we need to handle?
    /// * More tests with access to source code ...
    /// * Generating URL correctly?
    /// * Is the completion handler being called on the "happy day case", errors, etc.? The completion handler is a contract of something that should happen
